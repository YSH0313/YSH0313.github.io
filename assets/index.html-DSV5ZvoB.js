This makes your development code cleaner, reduces repetitive work, and makes the scraping code more standardized and easier to maintain.</p><p>Additionally, its concurrency features can also assist with some data processing tasks.</p><hr><h3 id="pacer-asynchronous-backend-framework" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pacer-asynchronous-backend-framework"><span><mark>Pacer</mark> Asynchronous Backend Framework</span></a></h3>',6)),t(r,{repo:"YSH0313/pacer",items:"stars,version,dm,license,source"}),e[2]||(e[2]=a('<p><a href="https://github.com/YSH0313/pacer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Pacer</code></a> It is a complete asynchronous backend framework designed specifically for <code>Python</code> engineers.
